About the Automation & Tools Group
==================================

Mozilla Automation and Tools ("the A-Team" for short) is a small group
dedicated to improving our automation infrastructure and tools to
better support all of Mozilla's Development and Testing efforts.

How to Talk to Us
-----------------

There's two main channels of communication for the group:

- The #ateam channel on `irc.mozilla.org <https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC>`_.
- The `tools@lists.mozilla.org mailing list
  <https://www.mozilla.org/about/forums/#tools>`_.

If you ever have a question, regardless of how difficult it is, you can share
it on those channels and someone should help you out. *Don't be afraid to ask
questions!* You're trying to help us, so it's only fair that we try to help you
in return.

Find a Mentor!
--------------

It's also a good idea to find someone to mentor you as a new contributor.
Having someone you can personally ask for help from is incredibly helpful in
finding your way around.

If you're a new employee, your mentor may be your manager, or it may be a
coworker. If you're a volunteer, ask someone who works on the project you want
to contribute to; if they cannot mentor you themselves, they should be able
to direct you to someone who can.
