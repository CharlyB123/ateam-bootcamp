Building locally
----------------
The instructions below assume you have Python and `pip`_ installed. It is also
strongly recommended that you create and activate a `virtualenv`_ first.

If you'd like to build the bootcamp locally:

.. code-block:: sh

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   make html

The resulting docs can be located under the ``_build/html`` directory.

.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io/
.. _virtualenv: https://virtualenv.pypa.io/
