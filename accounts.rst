Accounts You'll Need
====================

Most of the Mozilla web development process takes place between Bugzilla,
IRC, and GitHub. There are some other accounts you might need too. Here's
everything you should request when you start at Mozilla:

List of All Accounts (and How to Get Them)
------------------------------------------

Use the links to each app to get to their signup form.

* `Bugzilla`_ — use your @mozilla.com email to get 1337 access, and put your
  IRC nick or whatever you go by in your Bugzilla username for easier
  searching (example: ``Matthew Riley MacPherson [:tofumatt]``).
* `GitHub`_ — a free account is all that's required to develop on Mozilla web
  apps/sites. Ping ``jbalogh``, ``jsocol``, or your manager on IRC to get
  added to the right groups.
* IRC_ — check out the wiki to learn about Mozilla IRC. You should register
  your main nickname on IRC so it doesn't get stolen and so you can access
  any channels that require you to ``IDENTIFY``.
* Mercurial_ and ``svn`` — Sometimes things aren't in GitHub and you need to
  use ``hg`` or ``svn``. Locale files in particular are stored in Subversion
  for various reasons. Check out `Becoming a contributor`_ and be sure to ask
  for "Level 2 Mercurial Access".
