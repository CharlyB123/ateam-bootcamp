Mailing lists
-------------

Two mailing lists are the most important:

* `dev-webdev`_ is a public mailing list for all web developers in the Mozilla
  community. Sign up for it yourself, and use it for all webdev group
  communication that's not specific to people employed by Mozilla.
* ``webdev@`` is an internal mailing list specific to webdevs employed by
  Mozilla. Have your manager add you and use the list for topics that would
  not be interesting outside the Webdev group at Mozilla.

Additionally, many teams have their own, team-specific mailing lists. Check
with your manager and have her or him add you.

IRC
---

There's a Mozilla IRC server at ``irc.mozilla.org``. The `Mozilla IRC
server`_ page on the wiki talks about how to connect, how to ask
questions, and other things.

We hang out on a bunch of different channels:

* #webdev - general web development
* #flux - the `Rapid Development team`_'s channel
* #sumodev - development of `SUMO`_
* #input - development of `Input`_
* #mozillians - development of `Mozillians (Community Directory)`_
* #breakpad - development of `socorro, crash-stats, and breakpad`_
* #mdn - development of `MDN`_
* #amo - development of `AMO`_

   Add additional channels here.


Also of interest:

* #js - javascript programming discussion
* #nodejs - nodejs discussion

    Add other useful channels here. Is there one for HTML5?
