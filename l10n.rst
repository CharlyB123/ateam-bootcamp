===================
Localization (l10n)
===================

Most web apps at Mozilla are localized. We make use of ``gettext``.

See :ref:`playdoh:l10n` in Playdoh


.. _l10n-svn:

SVN
---

By convention Mozilla puts locales in `locale/` and that folder is a working
copy from SVN. This allows localizers to use tools like Verbatim_ to add new
localized content.

You can create an empty subdirectory off of
https://svn.mozilla.org/projects/l10n-misc/trunk/ to store your `.po` files::

    svn mkdir \
        https://svn.mozilla.org/projects/l10n-misc/trunk/$MYPROJECTNAME \
        -m "Creating $MYPROJECTNAME"

Where ``$MYPROJECTNAME`` is the name of your project.

You'll also want to add ``*.mo`` to the list of ``global-ignores`` in your
``~/.subversion/config`` file. ``.mo`` files can be compiled at deploy time.

.. warning::

    ``.mo`` files are compiled and therefore have no place in version control.

Now in your project root::

    svn co https://svn.mozilla.org/projects/l10n-misc/trunk/$MYPROJECTNAME \
    locale

Anytime you make changes using the ``merge`` or ``extract`` commands you'll
need to commit them back to SVN::

    cd locale/
    svn add *
    svn commit -m 'Locale update'

Make this better
----------------

This process is merely a suggestion. If you think localization can be improved
or perhaps automated, by all means... **DO IT!** If your improvement takes off
update this, so others can benefit.
