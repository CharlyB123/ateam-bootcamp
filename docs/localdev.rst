Developing Locally
==================

For many sites (AMO, SUMO, Input, etc),
developing locally is an easy achievement.

Developing locally
allows you to be able to work anywhere without relying on
network connectivity or being.

Homebrew (Mac OS X)
-------------------

Most web developers choose a MacBook Pro as their development machine.
Therefore we recommend Homebrew_.
Almost all the required development tools can be acquired via ``brew``:

* git
* sphinx
* mysql
* redis
* memcached
* python-2.7

If you need something that ``brew`` doesn't support, but you could otherwise
compile, you can create your own recipes.
