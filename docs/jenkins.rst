Jenkins: Continuous Integration
===============================

We have a public instance of Jenkins_ (formerly Hudson).
For most projects it runs their python
test suite.  Optionally we use it to do JS testing as well as any menial tasks
that need to be done regularly, like packaging.  If you break things you will
be warned in IRC.
