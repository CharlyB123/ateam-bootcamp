Glossary
========

At Mozilla we use a lot of special terms that mean specific, non-obvious
things to those who aren't familiar with them. This document attempts to
define those terms.

   Orange
      An "orange" refers to a test that fails intermittently.  They are called
      "oranges" because they turn our status reporting orange.  View current
      `list of "oranges" <https://brasstacks.mozilla.com/orangefactor/>`_

   pull request
   PR
      A term for a request on GitHub to merge some changes into a codebase.
      Pull requests are the primary place where code review happens for GitHub
      projects.

   r?
      Abbreviation for a request to review a piece of code.

   r+
      Abbreviation for passing a code review. In some cases, the r+ is
      conditional on additional changes being made, but subsequent
      review is not necessary after making them.

   r-
      Abbreviation for failing a code review. This usually means that more
      work is needed rather than rejecting the code outright. After the
      requested changes are made, another code review is required.
