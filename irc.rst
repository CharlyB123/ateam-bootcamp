IRC
===

There's a Mozilla IRC server at ``irc.mozilla.org``.  The `Mozilla IRC
server`_ page on the wiki talks about how to connect, how to ask
questions, and other things.

We hang out on a bunch of different channels:

* #webdev - general web development
* #sumodev - development of SUMO

.. todo::

   Add additional channels here.


Also of interest:

* #js - javascript programming discussion

.. todo::

    Add other useful channels here.  Is there one for HTML5?
